 <h1>Some Of The Best Movies Of All Time</h1>
 <h2>These are all timers (In no particular order)</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>1. Hot Fuzz</h3>
 <p>A seriously genius film. This is film 2 out of The Cornetto Trilogy and definitely the best. The easter eggs are fantastic, the foreshadowing throughout the film is rather genius, and it gets better with every watch.</p>

 <h3>2. Happy Gilmore</h3>
<p>Easily the best Adam Sandler film. I watched this many times as a kid and still find it just as funny as an adult today. I simply yearn to be able to drive the ball like Happy. RIP Chubbs.</p>

Woah Woah Woah <br />
It's magic you know <br />

<h3>3. Superbad</h3>
<p>Superbad is a great embodiment of youth and rebellion (despite me doing very little in my teenage years) and it is both equally heartwarming and hilarious. I could have picked any title for third place but it was mainly between this and Mohammed (read a book for once).</p>
